Rohith Reddy Avisakula-Section 01-Dr.Case/11:00 am

 

Preferred Name:Rohith

I am fresher of spring 2020 batch pursuing master's degree in Applied Computer Science.

 

I am from Tirupathi,India which is famous for Lord Venkateswara Swami Temple recognised as one of  the highest earning temple in the world.I completed my under graduation in Information Technology major from Pondicherry Engineering College in the year 2019. I don't have any industrial experience but I got a job offer from MNC, which is not related to my interest. So I opted master's in computer science which will help me in gaining in-depth knowledge to work as a Full Stack Developer. I also have  a curiosity to learn new technologies apart from the courses in this major.

 

My future aspect is to establish a startup company in India and  be as a part of developing India.
